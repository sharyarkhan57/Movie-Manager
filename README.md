# Movie-Manager
A simple movie manager which allows movies to be added to a list and then sorted by various data points.
After a user inputs a new movie, the data is requested using Open Movie Database's API. The movie is added to a list
as well as the star actors of the film. A running count of how many movies the various actors have appeared in is kept (movies added to the database) and the list of Movies and Actors can be sorted by various attributes such as alphabetically, release date, and number of movies.
